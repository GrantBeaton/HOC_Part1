<h1><u>Significance in Computer Science</u></h1>
<h1>What did he do?</h1>
<h2>Jack Kilby invented the integrated circuit (IC). This is probably the most important invention in our technology history. The integrated circuit, now known as the microchip, revolutionized the way that technology was produced and used. Before this, it was widely believed that a computer required wires and wires and programs and parts and devices, but he reduced this into one small chip that could do everything.</h2>

<h2> There is is!</h2>

<h1>How has it helped us?</h1>
<h2>The microchip invented by Jack Kilby is now a crucial part of any technological device we use today. Everything from a cell phone to Internet audio, to I-pads, computers. Everything benefits from his invention and without it we'd all never manage the amount of wires and clutter around our houses and classrooms.</h2>

<h1>What did he gain?</h1>
<h2>On December 10, 2000, Jack Kilby received a Nobel Prize for Physics for his invention of the microchip. He was congratulated not only by them but also the President at the time, Bill Clinton, who is quoted as saying, "You can take pride in the knowledge that your work will help to improve lives for generations to come."</h2>
