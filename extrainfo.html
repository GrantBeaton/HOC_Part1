    <h1><u>A bunch of other cool stuff</u></h1>
    <h1>1</h1>
<h3>Jack Kirby was not the only one working on the integrated circuit, he received the Nobel Prize as a co-recipient with two men named Herbert Kroemer and Zhores Alferov.</h3>
<h1>2</h1>
<h3>He didn't only invent the integrated circuit, as he was actually awarded over 50 patents that he was awarded. This includes things like the first IC-designed computer for the U.S Air Force in 1961 and a semiconductor based thermal printer in 1965. </h3>
<h1>3</h1>
<h3>Another invention of his that is almost as important as his invention of the microchip of today was the first IC-powered calculator, the Pocketronic, which earned him the patent that supports all modern day calculators. </h3>
<h1>4</h1>
<h3>He worked lots of jobs, mainly at Texas Instruments, where he did all of his inventing, but between 1978-84, he worked as a teacher at Texas A&M University. 
<h1>5</h1>
<h3>For his work, he did not just earn a Nobel Prize, but he also received the National Medal of Science, the Charles Stark Draper Medal and the National Medal of Technology. </h3>
<h4>Truly an underappreciated genius</h4>
